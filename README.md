### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**SneakyNinja2017/SneakyNinja2017** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently attending Drexel University.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently obtaining my Master's Degree in Librarianship and Information Science.

I really liked the data curation repository <a href="https://github.com/newTendermint/awesome-bigdata.git">"Awesome Big Data"</a> by newTendermint because it provides a lot of information and a variety of media methods on data curation RBDMs and frameworks along with programming software and example models of successful data curation already taking place online. This person is passionate about data curation and their repository demonstrates this with the extensive amount of references and information they have included.

<p>I also really like the preservation documentation search I completed which led me to <a href="https://github.com/DerekTurtleRoe/n64docs.github.io.git">N64Docs</a> by DerekTurtleRoe. They also were passionate about their documentation of metadata on everything made by Nintendo for the game console that is slowly becoming a rare game system to find. With the new playstations and Xboxes becoming more popular, the Nintendo 64 will eventually be seen as a relic and this person has made it their goal to document the importance Nintendo 64 had on many people. While we, as future librarians and archivists, focus more on the paper and digital media aspects of curation and preservation, this example shows another item that can be preserved by librarians or archivists if they chose to do so. From a librarian perspective, it could focus on the metadata and records of the Nintendo 64 as well as on the people who helped create the system. Documentation of what it looked like, how it worked, and what it was popular for could also be managed and curated by librarians. </p>
