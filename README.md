I really liked the data curation repository <a href="https://github.com/newTendermint/awesome-bigdata.git">"Awesome Big Data"</a> by newTendermint because it provides a lot of information and a variety of media methods on data curation RBDMs and frameworks along with programming software and example models of successful data curation already taking place online. This person is passionate about data curation and their repository demonstrates this with the extensive amount of references and information they have included.
